# Dealing with similarity as a classification Problem

Classifying a pair of sentences as similar or not similar using BERT involves a few steps, focusing on how to effectively represent the sentence pair and then classify them based on their similarity. Here's a high-level approach to tackle this problem:

**Preparing the Input**

1. **Tokenization**: First, tokenize both sentences using BERT's tokenizer. This involves converting each sentence into a series of tokens that BERT has been trained on.
2. **Special Tokens**: For BERT to understand that it's dealing with a pair of sentences and to maintain the context, you need to add special tokens:
    - `[CLS]`: At the very beginning of the token list.
    - `[SEP]`: To separate the two sentences and at the end of the second sentence.
    
    So, the input format looks like `[CLS] sentence 1 [SEP] sentence 2 [SEP]`.
    
3. **Attention Mask**: Since BERT inputs require a fixed length, you might need to pad shorter inputs. The attention mask allows BERT to differentiate between real tokens and padding tokens.

Processing with BERT

1. **Feeding to BERT**: Pass the prepared input through BERT. BERT will output an embedding for each token, including the special `[CLS]` token.
2. **Using the Output**: For similarity tasks, you can use the `[CLS]` token's embedding, the pooled output, as it is designed to represent the entire input's context. Alternatively, you could experiment with other strategies like averaging the embeddings of all tokens (mean pooling) to represent the sentence pair.

Classification Layer

1. **Similarity Score**: Add a classification layer on top of BERT's output. This can be a simple dense layer with a softmax activation to classify the sentence pair as similar or not similar. The choice of loss function can vary, but a common choice is binary cross-entropy for this binary classification task.
2. **Fine-tuning**: It's crucial to fine-tune BERT along with your classification layer on a dataset of sentence pairs labeled for similarity. This fine-tuning step adjusts the pre-trained BERT weights to perform better on your specific similarity classification task.

Example Workflow

- **Step 1**: Tokenize the sentence pairs with the special tokens.
- **Step 2**: Pass the tokenized pairs through BERT.
- **Step 3**: Take the `[CLS]` token's output (or apply another strategy like mean pooling across the tokens) to get a fixed-size sentence pair representation.
- **Step 4**: Pass this representation through a classification layer to predict similarity.
- **Step 5**: Train this model on a labeled dataset of sentence pairs, adjusting the BERT weights and the classification layer to optimize performance on the similarity task.

This approach allows leveraging BERT's powerful contextual embeddings to understand the nuanced similarity between sentence pairs, making it effective for tasks like semantic similarity, paraphrase detection, or other related natural language understanding tasks.
